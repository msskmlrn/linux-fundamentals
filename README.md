This repository contains my solutions to the exercises of the Linux fundamentals course https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/courses/582351/2013/s/k/1. The goal of the course was to teach basic and advanced scripting skills and provide an introduction to the program design philosophy of Linux and other UN*X-like operating systems. During the course, the participants were asked to complete weekly exercises that required the use of many common command line tools such as cat, ls, find, tar, date, grep and sed, often in conjunction with each other.

For example, one of the tasks was to find the highest and lowest temperature of one the department's server computers from a dataset. The server was set to automatically log status information every five minutes, so the task required the parsing of 192040 text files.
